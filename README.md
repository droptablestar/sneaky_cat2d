# SneakyCat2D

A side-scrolling stealth game.

## Core Rules
- Victory: reach the level exit
- Failure: get caught by an enemy
- Player actions (v1): move, hide
- Enemies patrol and detect the player via vision

## Design Notes
- Side-scroller with limited depth (foreground/background)
- Detection is gradual (meter fills/decays)
- Enemies can lose sight if the player hides behind depth-based cover

## Status
Greenfield rewrite. No gameplay implemented yet.
